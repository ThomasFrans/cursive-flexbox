A correct, complete flexbox implementation for the [Cursive TUI
library](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive). The implementation follows [the CSS3
specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/CR-css-flexbox-1-20181119/) where it makes sense for a
TUI. All implemented functionality should be exactly the same as for the CSS3 flexbox.
