# Cursive Flexbox
This aims to be a complete flexbox implementation for Cursive, a Rust TUI
library. It should be complete in the sense that it supports most things that
the CSS3 flexbox supports.

> Development of this library just started so of course, it isn't complete yet.
> Progress will be tracked [here](docs/status.md). API design is absolutely not final, and won't
> be before all major functionality is implemented.

## API and Guidelines
Once more things have been implemented and I have a general overview of the
status and implementation of the project, I'll start to work towards adhering to
[the general Rust guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).

## Contributions
Contributions are very much welcome. Keep in mind that the project just started
so there isn't much implemented yet.
