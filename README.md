# Cursive Flexbox ![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2023?style=flat-square)
> This library is not stable yet. It is under development and the API will change before the first

A correct, complete flexbox implementation for the [Cursive TUI
library](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive). The implementation follows the CSS3 specification where
it makes sense for a TUI. All implemented functionality should be exactly the same as for the CSS3
flexbox.

## Documentation
Documentation will be available after the first upload to crates.io. For now, it can be generated by
running `cargo doc --open`, which will open in the default web browser.

## API and Guidelines
Once more things have been implemented and I have a general overview of the status and
implementation of the project, I'll start to work towards adhering to [the general Rust
guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).

## Contributions
Contributions are very much welcome. Keep in mind that the project just started so there isn't much
implemented yet.
